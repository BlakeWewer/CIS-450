Quesiton 1: Analysis of Pointer Expressions

Consider the following program:

int a[2][3][2][3];

int (*b[2][3])[3] = {{a[0][1], a[1][1], a[1][0]},{a[1][2],a[0][2],a[0][0]}};

int (*(*c)[3])[3] = b;

int (***d)[3] = a;


int main()
{
	int i,j,k,m;
	int val;
	
	val = 1;
	for(i = 0; i < 2; i++)
	 for(j = 0; j < 3; j++)
	  for(k = 0; k < 2; k++)
	   for(m = 0; m < 3; m++)
		a[i][j][k][m] = val++;

LABEL:
	return 0;
}

Note:  some statements may cause compile time warning (due to type mismatch)
or run-time segmentation error (by accessing outside its address space).

Assume that the execution control is at LABEL. 
   What are the values of the following expressions:
  1. a[1][2]
  2. (**b)+2
  3. b[1][1][1][1]
  4. (*(c[1][2]+1))[2]
  5. d
  6. *d
  7. **d

 If the value is an address, then describe what the address corresponds to.
 For example, "a" denotes the address of a[0][0][0][0] (= &a[0][0][0][0])
 Note: "address of a (a[0], a[0][0], or a[0][0][0]" is not acceptable 
 since it is a constant.
  
 For each expression, write a sequence of derivation steps , just like the derivations shown in slides CIS450-2-17~19.
 For each step, write its type and value.

 Some expressions would cause meaningless memory accesses.
 But that is fine --- just apply the pointer arithmetic rules mechanically
 by assuming sizeof(pointer to some object) = sizeof(int) = 4.
 
 
Question 2: Pointer Declarations

Unzip to Assignment4.zip.
It contains a VC++ solution "Assignment4" and "Assignment4.pdf."
Refer to Assignment4.pdf. It has an integer array a[3][2][2][2] and pointer variables b~q.
Declare and initialize each variable b~q so that
  a[ii][jj][kk][mm]  = b[ii][jj][kk][mm] = ...= q[ii][jj][kk][mm] hold.
Complete the c program in Assignment4, just as we did in class on Exercise1 in PointerExercises in Chap2 in CoursePrograms.


How to submit:
1. Make a top-level submission directory after your LastName_FirstName (e.g., Mizuno_Masaaki in my case)
2. For Question 1, type your answer in a txt file or a doc file.  For Question 2, complete solution "Assignment4."
3  Put your document file for Question 1 and the solution directory "Assignment4" for Question 2 in your submission directory
4. Zip the whole submission directory and submit the zip fie in KSOL.
