Due: 12:20pm on 2/16/2018 (Friday)

0. Show that the following program running on Pentium prints
          fff0	f0
      fffffff0	f0
      
    ========== Program =================
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    void main() {
      char c;
      unsigned char uc;
      short s1, s2;
      unsigned short us1, us2;
    
      c = 0xf0; uc = 0xf0;
      us1 = c; us2 = uc;
      printf("us1 = %8x,\tus2 = %8x\n", us1, us2);
      s1 = c; s2 = uc;
      printf("us1 = %8x,\tus2 = %8x\n", s1, s2);
    }

  Show the following steps:
   Step1   show the values in c and uc
   Step2   show the integral promoted values of c and uc
   Step3   show the values in us1 and us2
   Step4   show the integral promoted values of us1 and us2 
   (these are the values printed by the first printf statement)
   Step5   show the integral promoted values of c and uc 
   (they are the same as those values in Step2)
   Step6   show the values in s1 and s2
   Step7   show the integral promoted values of s1 and s2
   (these are the values printed by the second printf statement)

1. Reverse compile question1.asm (obtain a possible source C program for
   question1.asm).
   The original program does not do any meaningful computation.
   
   You can assume all 4 byte variables to be of type (signed) int
   Determine the types of 2-byte and 1-byte variables from the code
   Hint: pay attention to integral promoted values of these variables
   
   Draw a memory image of the execution of the program.
   You must write the offsets of all the local variables and parameters
   But you do not need to simulate the execution or write values of any variable.
   (I do not even know if the program terminates)

2. Reverse compile question2.asm (obtain a possible source C program for
   question2.asm).
   The original program does not do any meaningful computation.
   
   You can assume all 4 byte variables to be of type (signed) int
   
   Draw a memory image of the execution of the program.
   You must write the offsets of all the local variables and parameters.
   But you do not need to simulate the execution or write values of any variable.
  
3. Reverse compile question3.asm.
 
   You can assume all 4 byte variables to be of type (signed) int
   Determine the types of 2-byte and 1-byte variables from the code

   Draw a memory image of the program executed on Pentium right before 
   printf is invoked  (call _printf)

   Based on the memory image you draw, trace the code and write exactly 
   what the program will print.
   You need to simulate the execution up to printf is called.
   You need to write values in all variables (up to printf is called)
   When a value in a variable is updated, cross off the old value (do not erase)
   and write the new value on the left side of the old value
   
   
How to submit:
1. Create the top-level submission directory after your LastName_FirstName 
   (e.g., Mizuno_Masaaki in my case)
2. In the top-level directory, create 4 directories and name them
   question0, question1, question2, and question3, respectively
3. In each sub directory , put your answer files

   For question0, explain the values of each step in English (txt, doc, or pdf file)
   For questions 1~3, submit your C program (text file) and drawing of a memory image
   (for drawing, you must use a drawing tool (hand drawing is not acceptable) and
   we only accept .ppt(x), jpeg, or pdf file).
   
4. Zip the top-level submission directory and submit the zip file in KSOL
