Assignment1
Due:  Do not turn in.  Just try on your own computer running Cygwin or Linux

Step 1: Read and understand the codes in file1.c and file2.c

Step 2: Compile (do not assemble or link) file1.c and file2.c
   gcc -S file1.c
   gcc -S file2.c
   
   The above commands yield file1.s and file2.s.
   Open file1.s and file2.s in an editor
   
Step 3: Assemble file1.s and file2.s
   gcc -c file1.s
   gcc -c file2.s
   
   The above commands yield file1.o and file2.o
   They are binary files and cannot be opened by an editor
   
   Delete file1.s and file1.o and issue
   gcc -c file1.c
   This command generates file1.o (but it deletes file1.s)
   
Step 4: Link file1.o and file2.o (and library files)
   gcc file1.o file2.o
   
   The above command yields a.out (a.exe in cygwin)
   
Step 5: Execute a.out (or a.exe)
   ./a.out    (or ./a.exe) 
   if you have added . (the current working directory) in the execution path, "./" is not necessary
