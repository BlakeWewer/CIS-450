EXECUTED CODE PRINTS:

us1 =     fff0, us2 =     f0
us1 = fffffff0, us2 =     f0   

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Steps
1) c = f0 	uc = f0
	These are the values entered into the variables in the c code.
2) c = fffffff0 	uc = 000000f0 
	These are the sign extended/zero extended values as found in assembly code. 
3) us1 = fff0  us2 = 00f0 
	These are the first two bits of the sign/zero extended values moved from c & uc to us1 & us2 respectively. 
4) us1 = 0000fff0 	us2 = 000000f0
	Both of these values are zero extended because they are unsigned. When printed, the beginning zeros are removed.
5) c = fffffff0 	uc = 000000f0 
	These are the sign extended/zero extended values as found in assembly code. 
6) s1 = fff0 	s2 = 00f0
	These are the firt two bits of the sign extended values moved from c & uc to s1 and s2 respectively. 
7) s1 = fffffff0 	s2 = 000000f0 
	These are the sign extended/zero extended values.  When printed, the beginning zeros are removed.
